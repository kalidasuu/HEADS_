General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat is available, but specific information about the technology being used and the eventual commercial production methods as well as the final products is not yet known. However, the technology and methods to commercially produce cell- cultured meat are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not yet have clarity on what these will entail. The composition of the final product is also not yet known. The general process for making cell-cultured meat contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing. The technology to produce cell-cultured meat at a commercial scale is still in development, and information about the methods to be used for commercial production and the composition of the final product are not yet known. Consequently, they have not finalized aspects of the technology and eventual commercial production methods to be used or the composition of the final product. As a result, certain information is not yet available to stakeholders\\u2014including cell-cultured meat firms themselves, regulators, and the public\\u2014about specific aspects of the technology and commercial production methods that will be used, such as the composition of the growth medium and of the final products. This lack of information results in unanswered questions about cell- cultured meat as it relates to the eventual technology and commercial production methods to be used and the composition of the final products. Some firms have developed prototypes of cell-cultured meat products as part of their research and development. In June 2019, FDA and USDA created three working groups to carry out the terms of the interagency agreement. FDA and USDA could more fully incorporate leading practices for collaboration in their interagency agreement and working groups. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. However, the agreement does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward outcomes. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. By more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for interagency collaboration early in the development of the three working groups, FDA and USDA could proactively minimize potential fragmentation and overlap in their oversight of cell-cultured meat, ensure consistency and efficient use of resources, and provide clarity to key stakeholders. While FDA and USDA officials told us they have decided who will oversee cell-cultured seafood, they have not formally announced or documented this decision, and some stakeholders have reported confusion or ambiguity about which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. While FDA and USDA officials told us they had agreed that FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, as of December 2019, the agencies had not formally announced or documented this agreement. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is a leading practice for collaboration, as we have previously reported. Compounding this challenge is that specific information about key aspects of cell-cultured meat, such as the technology and production methods to be used as well as the composition of the products, is not yet known. FDA and USDA officials told us they have decided FDA will oversee most cell-cultured seafood, but the agencies have not formally documented this decision. We agree that the technology to produce cell-cultured meat is still in development and that information about the commercial production methods and composition of the final product are not yet known, as we state in our report. FDA concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. USDA also concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. FDA and USDA partially concurred with our recommendation, directed to each agency, to more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into the agencies\\u2019 interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. We continue to believe that FDA and USDA should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into their interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. Our report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat and (2) examines the extent to which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat.

        "abstractive_summary = \"\"\"Multiple firms have produced cell-cultured meat as part of their research and development. These products appear likely to become available to consumers in coming years. FDA and USDA are the primary agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's food supply. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the agencies' oversight of cell-cultured meat amidst a fragmented federal food safety oversight system. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to selected cell-cultured meat firms. General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat\\u2014food products grown from the cells of livestock, poultry, and seafood\\u2014is available. However, no company is commercially producing cell-cultured meat. Specific information about the technology being used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the final products is not yet known. The general process contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing (see figure). The technology and methods to be used for commercial production are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications such as antibiotics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome, and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members' roles. Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate, the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities. GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies' interagency agreement. FDA and USDA partially concurred and indicated a willingness to incorporate these practices in a more detailed agreement, which would also meet the intent of the recommendations. The agencies concurred with the four other recommendations.\"\"\""

Information about the methods to be used for commercial production and the composition of the final product are not yet known. FDA and USDA could more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into their interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell- Cultured meat, the GAO says. The agreement does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward outcomes, the report says.. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is a leading practice for collaboration, as we have previously reported, it says. FDA concurred with two recommendations and partially concurring with one. USDA also concurred, but only partially, with a recommendation that the agencies incorporate the leading practices into the agencies’ interagency. agreement. The agencies have not formally announced or documented this agreement. While FDA and. USDA officials told us they had agreed that FDA would oversee cell- cultured seafood other than catfish, as of December 2019, the agencies had not formally. announced or. documented this decision. Some stakeholders have reported confusion or ambiguity about which agency will oversee Cell Cultured Seafood other than. catfish. We continue to believe that FDA and USDA should more fully. incorporate the. seven leading Practices for Effective Collaboration in their inter Agency agreement and working groups. The GAO report also asks how the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be funded to provide regulatory oversight ofcell-culturing meat. How will the collaborative mechanism be funded? The report says it will be developed and updated to ensure consistency and efficient use of resources, and provide clarity to key stakeholders. The agency has not yet formally announced that it will oversee cell Cultured seafood, but it has said it has decided FDA will oversee most cell-ultured seafood. It also has said that it has not decided who will overseeCell Cultured Meat.\n",

USDA has agreed to provide regulatory oversight of cell-ultured meat but hasn't formally announced this decision or documented it;. It is not clear how the U.S. Department of Agriculture will fund the collaborative mechanism;. There are questions about how much funding will be available for cell- cultured meat;. And there are concerns about the quality of the finished products;. They have not yet finalized aspects of the technology and eventual commercial production methods to be used or the composition of a final product. information is not yet available to stakeholders, such as cell-cultural meat firms themselves, regulators, and the public;. This lack of information results in unanswered questions about cell-culture meat as it relates to the eventual technology and production methods;. Compounding this challenge is that specific information about key aspects of Cell Cultured meat is not currently known. The GAO report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell Cultured Meat. The report (2) describes how the FDA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are collaborating to provide guidance and updates.\"}"

General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat is available, but specific information about the technology being used and the eventual commercial production methods as well as the final products is not yet known. However, the technology and methods to commercially produce cell- cultured meat are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not yet have clarity on what these will entail. The composition of the final product is also not yet known. The general process for making cell-cultured meat contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing. The technology to produce cell-cultured meat at a commercial scale is still in development, and information about the methods to be used for commercial production and the composition of the final product are not yet known. Consequently, they have not finalized aspects of the technology and eventual commercial production methods to be used or the composition of the final product. As a result, certain information is not yet available to stakeholders—including cell-cultured meat firms themselves, regulators, and the public—about specific aspects of the technology and commercial production methods that will be used, such as the composition of the growth medium and of the final products. This lack of information results in unanswered questions about cell- cultured meat as it relates to the eventual technology and commercial production methods to be used and the composition of the final products. Some firms have developed prototypes of cell-cultured meat products as part of their research and development. In June 2019, FDA and USDA created three working groups to carry out the terms of the interagency agreement.

However, the agreement does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward outcomes. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. By more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for interagency collaboration early in the development of the three working groups, FDA and USDA could proactively minimize potential fragmentation and overlap in their oversight of cell-cultured meat, ensure consistency and efficient use of resources, and provide clarity to key stakeholders. While FDA and USDA officials told us they have decided who will oversee cell-cultured seafood, they have not formally announced or documented this decision, and some stakeholders have reported confusion or ambiguity about which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish.

FDA concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. USDA also concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. FDA and USDA partially concurred with our recommendation, directed to each agency, to more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into the agencies’ interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat.
